4. Write the html and css for the page 
5. Test using hardcoded url's, titles, descriptions
  -create handlebars template for current video/title/description and templates for videos in list, based on the html I have already hardcoded
  -create a test object to test handlebars functionality
6. Build out code for all models, views, collection based on my handwritten diagram
  -create a mock final current collection and current video (should be a model)
7. add a click event, function and listener to each view and test 
    -that the click and function works
    -change the function to manipulate our test model/collection
    -test that the listener for the model/collection works by console logging when a change happens
    -now test rendering the page when the listener is triggered
